ypg.erl - Version 1.0
==============
a modified version of ymnesia.erl to work with postgresql

ymnesia.erl is found in the yaws source

yaws, an erlang based web server, is found at:

http://yaws.hyber.org/

ypg uses ajax to show results of table searches

Setup
==============

Compile ypg.erl

    erlc ypg.erl

put ypg.beam in a known ebin folder in yaws.conf

In yaws.conf add the appmods line for ypg:

<server localhost>
        port = 8080
        listen = 127.0.0.1
        docroot = /usr/local/var/yaws/www
        appmods = <web-path, ypg>
        appmods = <cgi-bin, yaws_appmod_cgi>        
</server>

You would then access ypg by going to:

http://host/web-path

Requirements
==============

1. jquery
2. postgresql
3. http://code.google.com/p/erlang-psql-driver/
4. A browser that supports the HTML5 slider widget
